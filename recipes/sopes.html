        <ul>
            <li>1 cup instant corn masa flour</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>4 dried california chiles, dried</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>4 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ lb skirt steak, carne asada</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon all-purpose meat seasoning</li>
            <li>2 cups corn oil</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the masa flour and ½ cup (120 ml) of water together with your hands. Once combined, add the rest of the water and knead until the dough forms a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pan or griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Pat the dough out into 6 flat circles.</li>
            <li>Fry the dough, turning frequently, until just lightly brown about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is cooked, shape the sopes by pinching the sides up to form a wall around the edge. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Rip the stems off the dried chiles and discard the seeds. Rinse the chiles, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Add the chiles to a small pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chiles and their cooking liquid to a blender and add 1 teaspoon of salt and the garlic. Blend until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes to a small pot of water and bring to a boil. Cook until the tomato skins split, then remove from the heat and drain, reserving ½ cup (120 ml) of the tomato water.</li>
            <li>Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with the reserved cooking liquid, oregano, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Blend until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Add the skirt steak and season with the meat seasoning and remaining teaspoon of salt. Cook the meat, flipping frequently until seared and cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the meat to a cutting board and cut into small pieces. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the corn oil in a deep, large pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Dip the sopes in the chile sauce, turning to coat completely.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, fry the sopes, flipping frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain the sopes on paper towels or a wire rack.</li>
            <li>To serve, fill the sopes with refried beans, carne asada, shredded lettuce, tomato sauce, Mexican crema, and queso fresco.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
